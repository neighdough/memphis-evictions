Background
-------------------------------

Evictions exact a tremendous toll on cities, neighborhoods, and the families that get caught up in the process, but despite their widespread impact on communities, accessing the data needed to better understand them remain hard to come by. One of the challenges in understanding evictions or forcible entry detainer (FED) actions is that many occur outside of the normal legal framework that has been established to guarantee the rights of both landlords and tenants. So called "self-help" evictions, while illegal in most states, remain common in many cities. In other instances, tenants will vacate a property after receiving an initial notice to vacate which doesn't any formal legal proceedings and while the effect is an eviction, the lack of court records make it impossible to accurately gauge the true frequency with which evictions occur within various neighborhoods.

The objective of this study is twofold: 1) to describe the communities in which legal evictions are most prevalent in the City of Memphis, and 2) to develop a methodology to better approximate the location and frequency of both legal and informal evictions throughout the city.

A variety of data will be employed to achieve the two objectives outlined above and will include both local as well as national data at both the neighborhood and property/address level.
